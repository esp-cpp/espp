DRV2605 Haptic Motor Driver
***************************

The `DRV2605` haptic motor driver component allows the user to configure and
play custom or preconfigured haptic feedback sequences via a serial interface
such as I2C. It supports directly driving ECM (eccentric rotating mass) and LRA
(linear resonant actuator) type haptic motors. It also supports fully custom
waveforms (e.g. via using the audio, pwm / analog functions) as well as a preset
library of 123 different haptic waveforms which can be played in sequences of up
to 8 waveforms.
