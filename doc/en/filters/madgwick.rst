Madgwick Filter
***************

The `MadgwickFilter` implements the Madgwick algorithm for orientation
estimation using an IMU. The algorithm is based on the paper `An efficient
orientation filter for inertial and inertial/magnetic sensor arrays`_ by
Sebastian Madgwick. It supports state / orientation estimation for both 6-axis
IMUs as well as for 9-axis IMUs.
