Base Compoenent
***************

The `espp::BaseComponent` provides a simple base class for all components in the
ESP-CPP package. It provides a simple interface for the component to be
initialized and to be updated.

It is not required to use the `BaseComponent` class, but it is recommended to
use as it provides a standardized API for logging and log management.
