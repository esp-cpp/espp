# TT21100 Example

This example demonstrates how to use the TT21100 driver. It is designed to work
with the ESP32-S3-BOX dev board, but can be adapted to work with other boards
which have a TT21100 chip.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example can be run on any board which has a TT21100 chip. The example is
designed to work with the ESP32-S3-BOX dev board.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
