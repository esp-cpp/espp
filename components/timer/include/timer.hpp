/// @brief A timer that can be used to schedule tasks to run at a later time.
/// @details A timer can be used to schedule a task to run at a later time.
///          The timer will run in the background and will call the task when
///          the time is up. The timer can be canceled at any time. A timer
///          can be configured to run once or to repeat.
///
///          The timer uses a task to run in the background. The task will
///          sleep until the timer is ready to run. When the timer is ready to
///          run, the task will call the callback function. The callback
///          function can return true to cancel the timer or false to keep the
///          timer running. If the timer is configured to repeat, then the
///          callback function will be called again after the period has
///          elapsed. If the timer is configured to run once, then the
///          callback function will only be called once.
///
///          The timer can be configured to start automatically when it is
///          constructed. If the timer is not configured to start
///          automatically, then the timer can be started by calling start().
///          The timer can be canceled at any time by calling cancel().
///
/// @note The timer uses a task to run in the background, so the timer
///       callback function will be called in the context of the task. The
///       timer callback function should not block for a long time because it
///       will block the task. If the timer callback function blocks for a
///       long time, then the timer will not be able to keep up with the
///       period.
