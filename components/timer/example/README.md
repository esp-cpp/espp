# Timer Example

This example shows some various different ways of starting and stopping timers,
as well as some different examples of ways the timers can be configured, such as 
repeating or one-shot, and how to use the timer's callback function.

## How to use example

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
