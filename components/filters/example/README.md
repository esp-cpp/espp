# Filters Example

This example shows how to use a `LowpassFilter`, `ButterworthFilter`, and
`SimpleLowpassFilter` from the `filters` component to filter signals. This
example simply operates on random perturbations of auto-generated data.

## How to use example

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
