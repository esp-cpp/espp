# ESP-BOX Example

This example shows how to use the `espp::EspBox` hardware abstraction component
to automatically detect and initialize components on both the ESP32-S3-BOX and
the ESP32-S3-BOX-3.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to run on the ESP32-S3-BOX or ESP32-S3-BOX-3.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view
serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
