# FT5x06 Example

This example demonstrates how to use the FT5x06 touch controller driver.

NOTE: I do not have an ESP32-S3-BOX variant with this touch controller, so I
have not been able to test this example.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to run on the ESP32-S3-BOX (specifically the variant
that has a FT5x06 touch controller).

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
