# Task Example

This example shows some various different ways of starting and stopping tasks,
as well as examples of how to wait, block, exit early, and run long-running
computations within tasks using the `task` component.

## How to use example

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)
