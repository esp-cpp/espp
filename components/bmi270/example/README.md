# BMI270 Example

This example shows how to use the `espp::Bmi270` component to initialize and communicate with a BMI270 6-axis IMU.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Basic IMU Reading**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data
- **Orientation Filtering**: Both Kalman and Madgwick filter implementations
- **Real-time Data Logging**: CSV format output suitable for plotting
- **Interrupt Configuration**: Data ready and motion detection interrupts
- **Advanced Configuration**: Performance modes, bandwidth settings, power management

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example can run on any ESP32 development board with I2C pins available. Connect a BMI270 sensor as follows:

| BMI270 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| VDD        | 3.3V      | Power supply |
| VDDIO      | 3.3V      | I/O power supply |
| GND        | GND       | Ground |
| SCL        | GPIO22    | I2C clock (configurable) |
| SDA        | GPIO21    | I2C data (configurable) |
| SDO        | GND       | I2C address select (0x68) |
| INT1       | GPIO (optional) | Interrupt 1 output |

### Configuration

You can configure the I2C pins through menuconfig:

```
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to: `BMI270 Example Configuration`

- **SCL GPIO Num**: I2C clock pin (default: 22). If running on M5Stack Tab5, set to 32.
- **SDA GPIO Num**: I2C data pin (default: 21). If running on M5Stack Tab5, set to 31.
- **I2C Clock Speed**: I2C frequency in Hz (default: 1000000)

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

The example outputs CSV-formatted data that includes:

1. **Timestamp** (seconds)
2. **Raw accelerometer data** (g)
3. **Raw gyroscope data** (°/s)
4. **Temperature** (°C)
5. **Kalman filter orientation** (radians)
6. **Kalman filter gravity vector**
7. **Madgwick filter orientation** (radians)
8. **Madgwick filter gravity vector**

### Data Analysis

The CSV output can be imported into analysis tools like:

- **MATLAB/Octave**: For advanced signal processing
- **Python (pandas/matplotlib)**: For data visualization
- **Excel/LibreOffice**: For basic analysis
- **[esp-cpp/uart-serial-plotter](https://github.com/esp-cpp/uart_serial_plotter)**: For real-time plotting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No device found (Device ID read fails):**
- Check I2C wiring (SDA, SCL, power, ground)
- Verify power supply voltage (3.3V)

**Noisy data:**
- Check power supply stability
- Add decoupling capacitors (100nF ceramic + 10µF electrolytic)
- Ensure stable mechanical mounting
- Consider using performance mode for gyroscope
- Adjust filter bandwidth settings

**No data updates:**
- Check if `has_new_data()` returns true
- Verify ODR (Output Data Rate) settings
- Check interrupt configuration if using interrupt mode
- Ensure proper timing in update loop

**Orientation drift:**
- Calibrate gyroscope offset
- Tune filter parameters (process/measurement noise)
- Consider magnetometer integration for yaw correction
- Check for temperature effects

### Debug Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```cpp
   config.log_level = espp::Logger::Verbosity::DEBUG;
   ```

2. **Check register values:**
   ```cpp
   uint8_t status = imu.read_u8_from_register(0x03, ec);  // STATUS register
   fmt::print("Status: 0x{:02X}\n", status);
   ```

3. **Monitor timing:**
   ```cpp
   auto start = esp_timer_get_time();
   imu.update(dt, ec);
   auto elapsed = esp_timer_get_time() - start;
   fmt::print("Update time: {} µs\n", elapsed);
   ```

## Performance Notes

- **Update Rate**: Up to 100Hz in this example (configurable)
- **Latency**: < 1ms for basic IMU reading
- **Memory Usage**: ~6KB stack for IMU task
- **CPU Usage**: < 5% at 100Hz update rate on ESP32-S3
- **Power Consumption**: ~685µA for BMI270 in normal mode

## Advanced Features

The example can be extended to demonstrate:

- **Motion Detection**: Any motion, no motion, significant motion
- **Step Counting**: Pedometer functionality
- **Activity Recognition**: Walk, run, still classification
- **Gesture Detection**: Wrist gestures, tap detection
- **FIFO Usage**: Batch data collection
- **Low Power Modes**: Optimized for battery applications
