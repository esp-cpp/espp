# ADXL345 I2C 3-Axis Accelerometer

[![Badge](https://components.espressif.com/components/espp/adxl345/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espp/adxl345)

The `Adxl345` component provides an interface to communicate with the ADXL345
3-Axis accelerometer using the I2C peripheral of the ESP32. It allows you to
read acceleration data along the X, Y, and Z axes, as well as configure various
settings of the accelerometer such as range, data rate, interrupts, and power
modes.

## Example

The [example](./example) shows the use of the `Adxl345` component to communicate
with an ADXL345 I2C 3-Axis accelerometer using the I2C peripheral of the ESP32.
