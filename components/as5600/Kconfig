          Set the minimum difference in encoder counts required to update
          the velocity calculation. If the absolute difference between the
          current and previous count is less than or equal to this value,
          the velocity will be set to 0. This helps filter out noise and
          small jitter in the encoder readings.

    config AS5600_USE_TIMER
        bool "Use high resolution timer instead of task"
        default y
        help
          Use the high resolution timer instead of a FreeRTOS task for
          periodic updates. The timer is more precise and has lower overhead.
          Disable this if you prefer to use a task-based implementation.
