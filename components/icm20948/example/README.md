# ICM20948 Example

This example shows how to use the `espp::Icm20948` component to initialize and
communicate with an ICM20948 9-axis IMU.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example is designed to run on a QtPy Pico or QtPy ESP32-S3 with an ICM20948
qwiic breakout board connected over I2C.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view
serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
