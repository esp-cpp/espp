      Use the legacy I2C API (i2c.hpp). This is compatible with ESP-IDF versions < 6.0.
      This is the default for compatibility with existing code.

config ESPP_I2C_USE_NEW_API
    bool "Use new I2C API (i2c_master.hpp/i2c_slave.hpp)"
    help
      Use the new I2C API (i2c_master.hpp/i2c_slave.hpp). This is only available for ESP-IDF >= 5.4.0.
      This API is modern, type-safe, and supports the latest ESP-IDF features.

      This API will be required for ESP-IDF 6.0 and later, as the legacy API is deprecated.

      Disable deprecation warnings for the legacy I2C API (i2c.hpp).
      This is useful if you are using the legacy API and do not want to see warnings about its deprecation.
      Note that this may hide important warnings about future compatibility.
