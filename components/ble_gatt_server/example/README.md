# BLE GATT Server Example

This example shows how to use the `espp::BleGattServer` class to create and manage
a BLE GATT server.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

This example should run on any ESP32s3 development board as it requires no
peripheral connections.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
