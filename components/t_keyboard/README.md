# LilyGo T-Keyboard Component

https://components.espressif.com/components/espp/t_keyboard/badge.svg

The `TKeyboard` component provides a simple interface to the T-Keyboard
keypad. It allows you to read which key is currently pressed.

Note: the t-keyboard (default firmware) doesn't use the interrupt output to
indicate when a new key is pressed.

## Example

This example shows how to get the user input (key presses) from the LilyGo
T-Keyboard. It is designed to run on a LilyGo T-Deck.
