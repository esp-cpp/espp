# M5Stack Tab5 Board Support Package (BSP) Component

[![Badge](https://components.espressif.com/components/espp/m5stack-tab5/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espp/m5stack-tab5)

The M5Stack Tab5 is a highly expandable, portable smart-IoT terminal development device featuring a dual-chip architecture with rich hardware resources. The main controller uses the **ESP32-P4** SoC based on the RISC-V architecture with 16 MB Flash and 32 MB PSRAM. The wireless module uses the ESP32-C6-MINI-1U, supporting Wi-Fi 6.

The `espp::M5StackTab5` component provides a singleton hardware abstraction for initializing and managing all the Tab5's subsystems including display, touch, audio, camera, IMU, power management, and expansion interfaces.
