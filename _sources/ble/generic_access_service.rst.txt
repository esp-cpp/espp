Generic Access Service
**********************

The `GenericAccessService` implements the required standard BLE Generic Access
service, providing device information from a BLE peripheral to a BLE central.

It should be noted that as a developer, you are not required to use this
service, as one is created for you automatically by the BLE stack.

I'm not really sure why I created this file, but I have so here we are.
